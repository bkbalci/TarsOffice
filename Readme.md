### Local development

You'll need to set up some secrets in order to be able to run this app locally, namely Google client Id and secret.
To get these values, you should create a new OAuth Web application in Google Cloud Platform - Credentials page.
Follow the instructions on this page: [Google external login setup in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/google-logins?view=aspnetcore-3.1). You can use the same configuration keys.
